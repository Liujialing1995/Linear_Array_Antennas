Linear_Array_Antennas
=====================
This repository contains a collection of Matlab codes which were modelled during the course of my Summer Research Fellowship at Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore.
These Matlab files support the results presented in the report, "A comparision between the methods of synthesis of Linear Array Antennas".
The project was completed under the guidance of Prof. N. Balakrishnan, Supercomputer Education and Research Centre(S.E.R.C.), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India.
